# Minecraft-discord-autoclicker

I got bored of the typical autoclickers that are detected extremely easy, so I decided to make one that is undetectable, currently it is not detected by any client or ss tool, it uses discord to work, I will not explain its use since it is really simple. Currently it only has autoclick and autosword, in the future I will add options, such as throwpot, autorun, criticals and others that do not take me more than 10 minutes to program haha.

It should be clarified that it is paid, it will give away only 10 licenses, to (buy / claim your free license) you must write to my discord (Friday # 9652) and send me your HWID, to people who do not reach to get it for free I will be selling it for only 10 dollars.

Finally an apology to the English speakers who read my terrible English haha.
